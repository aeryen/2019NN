xxperiod we traveled with another couple / friend who also had a daughter the same age as mine - xxunk , and we both agreed , it was just the perfect vacation , and we just had the best time while there xxperiod we were greeted with a warm welcome and drinks while checking in , it could not have started better xxperiod i was also 15 wks pregnant and worried at first , but had no issues at all xxperiod we got there very early at about 1 pm , but check into the room was not until 4 pm ( i ' m guessing the people before had a late check out and they still had to get the rooms ready ) , and they will hold your suitcase up front with the concierage until they bring them to your rooms , so after we xxperiod checked in at the desk , we went to our suitcases got some bathing suits for us and the kids and changed in the bathrooms , put on some sunscreen , and headed to the pools xxperiod we did not mind a bit , as that 's all we want to do anyway - is get out there in the sun xxperiod through the week , we noticed there were lots of families , but also lots of honeymooners - - as there was a wedding everyday that we were there xxperiod lots of singles and young couples too , but the place is so big , that we did not feel like we were intruding on anyone 's vacation , and yet there were also lots of families there too that we met , so it was a good mix xxperiod so here is the run down of each part : the grounds : yes , it is very large , and yes it is very spread out , but it never bothered us xxperiod it was such a beautiful tropical well - maintained ground that the girls loved it , and we did not mind the walks xxperiod our rooms were next to each other and was in the closest building you could get to the beach pool xxperiod but the nighttime buffets and restaurants are all at the other end ( the front ) where is is about a 15min walk xxperiod but being that we ate so much every night , it was no issue for us , and the girls loved looking at everything xxperiod we both did bring strollers and so glad we did for them xxperiod the pool / beach : the pools and beach are very close to each other xxperiod the pool ( there are 2 , on either side of the complex , but they are the same ) is a huge xxunk pool and has a swim - up bar xxperiod one end of it has a walk - in wading area , which most of the families seem to hang near , since the kids can just walk in at there own pace and play and not have to worry too much about it getting too deep xxperiod since it 's so huge , honeymooners and couples hung mostly near the bar and the other side of the pool , which again , the pool is so big , that no one was bothered by anyone of the different types of people staying at the hotel xxperiod the chairs and cabanas and thatched umbrellas : we got a cabana everymorning , when our girls woke up at about 7:00am , one of us walked out and put some of our things there to reserve it for us and our friends xxperiod we like the one spot in xxunk because it was close to the shallow end of the pool , but when we went to breakfast usually by about 8:30 / 9 , there were still plenty of thatched umbrellas and sunny chairs left all over xxunk xxperiod we had read on here to get out early to claim your spot , so we did , but i do not think it would not been that big of an issue even an hour or so later xxperiod beach was very nice xxperiod the waves were just like here at the nj shore - - not to big , not to small - - enough were i trusted my xxunk old daughter to run back and forth with her bucket and pail to get water xxperiod there was a bunch or seaweed in a thin line across the beach , but they do rake it up every morning , and it was mostly only there on the windy days - - it was windy ( a nice breeze so you did not feel hot ) all the days until the last days of our trip - - thur , and fri , xxperiod and then there was barely any seaweed at all - - if any xxperiod there are xxunk of water xxunk to choose from : my husband did kayaking , sunfish surfing , and we were going to paddle xxunk one day , but just never got around to it xxperiod they also have parasailing and boat tours , , etc xxperiod lots to do xxperiod - - - we brought a raft with us to float on since we read some reccomended it , and we are so glad we did xxperiod it was so worth it xxperiod i floated around in it while reading my book in the pool and we carried drinks on it as we picked them up from the bar xxperiod xxunk were done with it , we passed it onto another family who had just gotten there and they were so grateful and we told them to do the same - - just pass it one when they are done xxperiod if you buy a raft there - it is $ 20 bucks xxperiod we bought ours at wal - mart before we left for $ 6 and it was small enough to fit in my husbands suitcase - - about the size of xxunk that it was very worht it xxperiod i reccomend bringing a float xxperiod the rooms : we could not have gotten a better room is we asked for it xxperiod we were in the very last building in 36 , which is the closest you can be to the pool , the beach , and lunch buffet xxperiod it was perfect xxperiod they were very nice and roomservice came xxunk daily basis and were very kind xxperiod the second day we were there , we did not have hot water , so we called the front desk and told them , someone was there to fix the problem within 5minutes , and we never had a problem after that xxperiod the crib was okay , did it 's job , and my xxunk never seemed to care xxperiod there is a coffemaker , a frdge w / fresh water and soda everyday xxperiod it was a very nice basic room xxperiod the rs rooms i think have there own area and own pool , not near the other stuff , but def far from the beach if you enjoy the beach xxperiod the food : first of all , you must realize you are going to another country to eat different kinds of food xxperiod you are not going to an american style country buffet xxperiod so to those people who complain , would never travel well in any other country , in my opinion xxperiod we ' ve traveled a lot - caribean to europe and we have yet to go anywhere where the food was bad xxperiod to say it : the food was good xxperiod the buffets changed every day , but yet at the same time , do get a bt tiresome at the end of the week xxperiod there is a fresh make - to - order pasta station that was always good and reliable if you do not like the other choices , as well as a fresh make - to - order omelette station in the xxunk xxperiod we were nervous to eat some of the fresh vegetables , until i just said what the heck - - go for it - and i never got sick , and no one else did , and i ate a salad xxperiod my friend actually saw them pouring bottled water into the pasta cooker , which tells me prob most of their things they wash in bottles / purified water xxperiod we did not drink any of the tap water obviously , but did drink the drinks with ice - cubes and had no problems - - none of us our of 4 adults and 2 children xxperiod the restaurants : we ate at the thai / chinese place , which was very good , twice xxperiod we ate at the mexican , which was okay , and the mediterranian , which was also very good xxperiod we could never get reservations for a good time at the hibachi , because it was 6 of us , but that did not bother us to much , since we figured we live by one at home anyway xxperiod the kid 's clubs : we went one day to check it out - - there is an open playground where kids and parents can go play xxperiod the staff is in there with the mid - aged group doing activities and the kids seem totally engaged and having fun xxperiod i asked to look inside where the baby club is , although he had xxunk to leave my daughter , ( since we traveld with our friend so we could alternate nights / days of who goes out alone ) i have worked in childcare for 11 + years and could tell it was a good , nice , clean place xxperiod the teachers were very attentive , and were even a little wary about letting me come in - - which is nice for security purposes xxperiod the rooms were clean , had a / c and the cribs were all clean xxperiod there were about 3 babies in there , i ' m guessing maybe xxunk , 12 , xxunk xxperiod and all seemed happy xxperiod i would feel very xxunk leaving my daughter there if we decided we needed it xxperiod they have at nighttime a kids dance and also the flinstones characters will come out to meet the kids xxperiod i never saw the older kids , so they must ' ve been out and about xxperiod the staff : royal service ' we did not go for it , nor did i ever feel like i missed it xxperiod the staff was unbelieveably nice and helpful and always right there asking what they could do for us all the time - - we love it xxperiod they were just so friendly and always seemed so happy xxperiod we did not have the rs , but i think it 's prob a waste of money xxperiod i did not need a scented pillow every night nor a butler for whatever xxperiod the concierage will pick up my bags - - they do that automatically anyway xxperiod in my opinion , i would not want to stay in the rooms / buildings anyway , because for us , they are just too far from the beach and the pool xxperiod we love being around people and seeing what 's happening around us and just steps back to our room if we need to run and grab something xxperiod i think rs is a waste xxperiod we had a fantastic time , and we all agreed we would go there again and reccomend it to anyone else to go too\""]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":27}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"b56kux4PAFn3","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["class
