       "xxbos a truly fantastic place xmas we have just returned from a 2 week xmas new year break at the excellence punta cana xxperiod the hotel is magnificent and we have never experienced such incredible service before xxperiod the restaurants are great , with plenty of choice xxperiod the whole complex is so good that we only did one trip and that was for my wife to swim with the dolphins xxperiod great beaches and pools xxperiod the staff fall over each other to look after you xxperiod we stayed in a junior suite on ground level and it was spotlessly clean , great maid service and room service on tap 24 / 7 xxperiod overall i would say this is probably the best hotel we have ever stayed in on xxunk i am extremely fussy xxperiod the journey to the resort is a little uncomfortable , with the roads in a bad state xxperiod but once you are checked in the pace of life xxunk down and you forget about the outside world xxperiod worthy of special mention and our sincere thanks are : pedro from the cielo bar / pool an absolute gentleman xxperiod miguel the bell boy and also carlos from the xxunk bar xxperiod we will definately be booking again , probably for next christmas xxperiod jim eileen ( xxunk uk ) xxperiod,xxbos my husband and i stayed here for six days on our honeymoon xxperiod it was the most incredible resort xxperiod the rooms were comfortable and lovely , and the service was impeccable xxperiod we were so impressed we are looking into the other excellence resorts for our next vacation xxperiod we loved that it was all - inclusive xxperiod get hungry at 3 am xxperiod no problem , just call room service xxperiod the restaurants were impressive , and the bars were really nice xxperiod everything about the resort was visually appealing , clean , and luxurious xxperiod there were all sorts of things to do , also xxperiod we went horseback riding , spent a day in the spa ( amazing xxperiod ) , saw a circus and a magic show , and walked through the botanical garden , all within the resort xxperiod most other places ( marinarium , bavaro tours ) will pick you up right in front of the lobby if you want to do activities outside the resort xxperiod i definitely would not rent a car , though , unless you are comfortable driving amongst maniacs xxperiod seriously , though , if you are looking for a place to get away from everything , excellence at punta cana is the perfect choice xxperiod our honeymoon could not have been better xxperiod,xxbos best hotel in the dominican it was our 4th time to the domincan , this hotel was by far a superior class xxperiod resort : a very private resort where noise is kept to a minimum as it is chidren free and geared towards adults xxperiod plently of places to relax so it is not over - crowded xxperiod there were lots of different seating ranging from loungers to four poster beds both on the beach and around the pool , with plently of towels xxperiod the reception is large and spacious and very comfortable xxperiod the reception staff are very helpful , especially charismatic edwin xxperiod the unique design of the resort means that you do not get wet walking from the rooms to the restaurants during the tropical showers xxperiod rooms : there was a 4 poster bed , luxury furnishings and it was very comfortable xxperiod well maintained and clean xxperiod it was a spacious room with good seperate shower xxperiod dvd players in the room xxperiod the tv channels are limited and very geared towards the us market , no english footie or news xxperiod facilities : there is waiter service wherever you lay your hat xxperiod they will take drinks orders as well as deliver pizza on the beach xxperiod there are 8 restaurants for the evening dinners to satisfy most taste buds xxperiod if you have any special food requirements e xxperiod vegetarian , see ramon , manager of barcelona restaurant , he will make anything for you xxperiod ( thank you ramon , you made our holiday ) xxperiod the head chef , mr dettweitler is world xxunk and ensures that all of the food is of the highest quality , they are very lucky to have him there xxperiod the breakfast and lunch buffets are fantastic offering a large choice of food xxperiod felix the manager of the toscana is very polite and helpful xxperiod the gym is the most modern we have ever seen in a hotel with state of the art equipment and it is well maintained xxperiod general : they create a very comfortable atmosphere and nobody violates your space in any way , but they are always there if you need them xxperiod it is a very easy place to settle in to xxperiod go for it , you will not be disappointed xxperiod mr and mrs xxunk xxperiod,xxbos our trip our trip to the dominican republic was okay xxperiod we stayed at the excellence resort xxperiod it would have been excellent if we did not have so many problems getting the service that we paid for xxperiod when we called to get something fixed like the leaking ceiling or the toliet that stopped working , it took forever xxperiod numerous times there was not any towels for the next day or the mini bar was not restocked with the things that we liked xxperiod the thing that saved the trip was the entertainment staff xxperiod they were always smiling and asking if you were having a good time xxperiod they got you involved in the activities that were going on like dancing and spanish lessons xxperiod also , they had really good shows that were funny and entertaining xxperiod juan carlos , cesar and all the girls there were excellent xxperiod i think that it is very beautiful and relaxing there but i would definately let my friends know about the advantages and disadvantages of my trip and let them decide of they would want to go xxperiod,xxbos not the same the second time my wife and i just returned from excellence where we stayed from 11 / 21 - 11 / 26 xxperiod this was our second time staying at excellence and was far less enjoyable than our first visit in july 2007 xxperiod here are some of the issues we noticed this time : * the pool chair / towel insanity xxperiod as previous reviewers have mentioned , most pool chairs are reserved with towels and personal belongings by 9:00 am and all towels are gone from the towel shelves by this time as well xxperiod so if you have a massage in the morning or go horse back riding at 10 am or simply want to sleep in you literally will have no place to sit at the pool and no way to get a pool towel xxperiod there seems to be no recognition from the staff that this is a problem xxperiod * the food xxperiod while i appreciate the resort 's variety of food options , including asian , french , mexican , pizza , hamburgers / sandwiches , and italian , the result is that none of the food is particularly good xxperiod the best food is the simplest , like breakfast buffet items and food from the grill like hamburgers xxperiod asking chefs in a tropical resort to be experts in japanese or french food is going to lead to disappointment for most people xxperiod some of the food was okay , but we left dinner most night unsatisfied and sometimes still hungry xxperiod xxunk the problem is that the menus are written by workers with a limited command of english , describing food that they probably do not have a good idea about xxperiod as a result you sometimes literally have no idea what you are ordering xxperiod like others have mentioned , both my wife and i got sick during our time at excellence xxperiod since we never left the resort , we can only assume that some food or drink at the resort was the problem xxperiod we have traveled to various places in the caribbean and to xxunk in africa and have never gotten sick like we did at excellence xxperiod while we enjoyed aspects of our trip , we were disappointed that we would have to deal with these issues at a 5 star resort xxperiod\n",

       "xxbos definitely not a 5 star resort i ' m dumbfounded that this hotel gets good reviews and is so highly rated xxperiod it 's decidedly a 3 star property , not 5 stars as indicated xxperiod the rooms are very dated and run down , old crappy beds and pillows , an old tv and overall poorly maintained xxperiod the whole property is pretty run down and old - looking xxperiod the food is subpar , not one meal i had would be called great xxperiod the service is uneven and the staff is poorly trained and uninformed xxperiod many do not comprehend english xxperiod the beach is great , it 's the only redeeming factor xxperiod however the resort is a 1- hour taxi trip from the airport xxperiod,xxbos facilities need work xxperiod we visited excellence for 5 nights in december xxperiod our first room , # xxunk , had a safe that did not work and so - so air conditioning xxperiod when we went to the front desk to complain , we were told to go to the room and someone would be there within 15 minutes xxperiod 45 minutes later , the safe guy showed up , but nobody for the a / c xxperiod the safe guy could not fix it xxperiod when he left , the electricity went out xxperiod it went out a second time before we finally went to the front desk to change rooms xxperiod we had dinner that night in the lobster house xxperiod do not waste your time on this one xxperiod the lobster tails had about 2 bites of food included xxperiod while we were in there , the electricity went out again xxperiod room xxunk served us pretty well , until night # 3 when my partner got up to go to the bathroom and stepped into an inch of water xxperiod a hose had broken on the back of the toilet and flooded our room xxperiod it would ' ve been ok , but when we went to the front desk we were told that we needed to wait until noon to see if perhaps they could move us to another room xxperiod the front desk clerks were not xxunk to just move us xxperiod my partner was infuriated that they wanted us to wait 4 hours for a new room xxperiod finally , matias at the front desk finally arranged to have us moved to another upgraded room - xxunk xxperiod we walked in and saw the leak coming from the ceiling and nearly flipped xxperiod we finally got into # xxunk , which was a gorgeous suite with a beautiful view xxperiod on the positive side , the food at the other restaurants was very good xxperiod i particularly liked the french restaurant , while my partner liked the asian restaurant xxperiod the breakfast buffet was like nothing i 'd ever seen before - lots of choices xxperiod the ocean was way too rough to enjoy , particularly if you 're not a strong swimmer xxperiod much of the beach was black flagged the entire time we were there , so if you 're a big ocean fan , i do not recommend this resort xxperiod my favorite part , by far , though , were the beds next to the pools and ocean xxperiod they were amazing xxperiod i guess you could particularly say so since the beds in the rooms were hard as rocks xxperiod all in all , a good trip - highly recommend the zip line tour xxperiod it was worth every penny xxperiod,xxbos excellence was exactly that xxperiod my family and i stayed at the excellence punta cana from december 22 to december 29 of this year xxperiod it was an amazing time had by all that attended xxperiod we arrived at the resort around 4 am because of a delay at the airport in vancouver , but even at 4 am , the service of the bellhops and the front desk was up to par xxperiod our bags were unloaded and immediately tagged and set to one side of the lobby while we were handed cold scented towels to cool off with xxperiod check in was fairly expedient and we were in our rooms within twenty minutes xxperiod i had never been to an all inclusive resort before , and wasted no time enjoying the pleasures of the mini bar in the room , as well as the ample storage space for our things xxperiod room service even at 4 am was great , the girl on the phone said it would be about 40 minutes for the food , which seemed a little long , but i think they only say that to cover there butts , because it took about 25 minutes at most xxperiod the activities during the day were well thought out , though , there was some delays and cancellations due to weather conditions ( beach volleyball cancelled to due strong winds xxperiod the entertainment staff was amazing and extremely friendly , a special thanks to all my friends , ines ( my fiance , ) altagracia ( who lovingly xxunk to me as xxunk loco , which translates into crazy skinny guy , ) xxunk and johanna ( my disco dance partners , ) sexy cesar ( who taught me all the sexy dance moves i xxperiod now know , ) julio cesar ( the mc for the games and parties xxperiod the restaurants i ca not offer too much help with , i did not eat at all of them , but of the few i did eat at , i recommend toscana for the huge buffet everyday , breakfast here is well prepared and quite delicious ( although i do not recommend the scrambled eggs xxperiod the omlettes are delicious and you have to try one xxperiod for lunch , you have to check out the grill on the beach , different food everyday , always good , and makes the beach smell amazing xxperiod for dinner , i liked spice ( asian cuisine , ) agave ( mexican , but do not eat the xxunk from here , very rubbery , ) the pizza that is delivered to the pool and the beach is awesome , make sure you try that xxperiod the bars were awesome , you get accustomed to speaking the language when ordering drinks , instead of drinking your usual bacardi and coke , try the brugal extra anejo , they call it the dominican xxunk , and it 's obvious why once you try it xxperiod the stuff tastes amazing and it does magic for someone trying to loosen up on the dance floor xxperiod the disco is great too , although sometimes a little empty , but still worth checking out xxperiod the worst part of my trip was the vendors , they do not let up , and i am a very well mannered person , which makes it hard to shut them down over and over again , make sure you do not tell them you like anything until you know you 're going to buy it , otherwise you 'll have to beat xxperiod them off with a stick to get away xxperiod try to make it to the theatre for the shows at 10 pm every night , they are worth it xxperiod the ice breaker shows are fun too , it gets people into the swing of things xxperiod all in all , i would highly recommend this resort for anyone going on a honeymoon or a romantic time with the better half , there is not a very big single crowd , so parents beware taking your single sons and daughters to this resort if they 're looking to party with other singles xxperiod hope this helps you xxperiod adios amigos and xxunk xxperiod,xxbos great service , nice hotel , mediocre food xxperiod my husband and i stayed at excellence for five nights mid - november xxperiod we booked our trip at the very last minute so we were not able to do a ton of research on the dominican but the hotel receives high ratings xxunk the web xxperiod after the one hour ride from the airport we arrived at the hotel and were greeted by everyone we met xxperiod i have to say that the staff at the hotel were very nice and made every effort to learn our names and greet us by name each time they saw us xxperiod we opted to upgrade to the excellence club and we are still trying to decide if we think it was worth it or not xxperiod as part of the excellence club , you are ushered to the club 's private lobby for check - in but , really , it almost just creates an xxunk step in the check - in process and adds another person or two you feel like you should tip xxperiod the biggest benefits of the excellence club for us were the unlimited internet access , beach towels in the room ( they were hard to get otherwise ) , and the beach bag in our room xxperiod we did eat breakfast each morning in the excellence club which was nice because it was a small buffet and you did not have to deal with a crowd xxperiod the hotel itself was clean , the staff was very friendly , and nothing ever felt crowded xxperiod however , the food was not great xxperiod it was not bad - but it was not great xxperiod i ' m not a big eater but i was prepared to indulge on my vacation and there just was not anything i was crazy about xxperiod the presentation of the food was nice but it was just bland xxperiod i think that is the best way to describe it xxperiod the pizzas that were delivered to the pool area were good but it was unpredictable because you never knew when they would arrive xxperiod we went on two excursions - swimming with the sting - rays / sharks and the zip - line tour xxperiod we loved the zip - line excursion xxperiod the staff was great and our bus driver and tour guide were great xxperiod it was interesting to visit the sting - rays and swim with the sharks but the reef where we snorkeled was disappointing xxperiod the fish were very small and there was not much to see xxperiod the electricity went out in our room a handful of times , especially when i used the hairdryer xxperiod also , our ac was terrible xxperiod they tried to repair it but it just never got cool xxperiod our room was big , though , and clean xxperiod we always got housekeeping service twice a day and they refilled our mini - bar daily xxperiod in many of the reviews , people said they got sick xxperiod our representative at the hotel ( through aaa ) warned us that many people think they get sick from the water or the food but they do not realize that having too many drinks with coconut in them will also do it xxperiod coconut is a natural laxative so you need to limit your consumption xxperiod i would still pack the immodium just to be sure xxperiod i could not decide if i wanted to give this hotel a 3 / 5 or a 4 / 5 but i decided to go up because of the friendly staff and the cleanliness of our room xxperiod i do not think i would go back because of the food but we had a nice time while we were there xxperiod we met a lot of great people at the swim up bar xxperiod,xxbos very relaxing experience just returned from my 40th birthday romantic getaway with my husband xxperiod this was our first time in the dominican republic , and we have literally been to every single island in the caribbean xxperiod so i can assure you that my review will be short , sweet , and comprehensive xxperiod in general , we liked the dr , and the excellence was very nice xxperiod the top reasons why we liked excellence were : 1 ) no kids ( ie xxperiod , if i want to get away from my own kids , i definitely do not want to vacation with other peoples ' kids ) xxperiod it was so quiet xxperiod 2 ) the staff and the people in the dr in general xxperiod so genuinely friendly , helpful , and wonderful xxperiod believe me , this is not true in most other areas of the caribbean xxperiod the all - inclusive feature xxperiod loved being served , served , served xxperiod i wanted to sit on my [ - - ] all day and just be a xxunk pig xxperiod and this is the perfect place to do it xxperiod 4 ) the best selection of beach and pool lounge chairs , beds , and hammocks i ' ve ever seen xxperiod there were palapas everywhere , so there was no shortage of shade xxperiod there were so many beds , you did not have to worry about not getting one xxperiod i 'd never had the chance to sleep on a beach bed , because usually hotels have only a few , so you end up looking xxunk at the lucky few who get them xxperiod ok , so here 's what i did not love about excellence :1 ) beach is not swimmable xxperiod way too rough most of the time xxperiod for this reason alone , i 'd not return here xxperiod i ' m a beach fan , and love to swim in the warm caribbean sea xxperiod i ' m no food snob , but some of the food was downright bad xxperiod and you end up eating in the same spot for breakfast and lunch xxperiod even though they have like 7 restaurants - the majority of them are only open for dinner xxperiod we only stayed 4 nights , and we were definitely getting very tired of the breakfast / lunch selection by the 3rd day xxperiod overall , if you just want to relax by the pool and you do not care about not going in the beach , this is a very beautiful resort xxperiod the staff is wonderful xxperiod if you are looking for a place to party and be loud and crazy , this is not your place xxperiod\n",
