? tell whether or not the headboard was attached properly xxperiod the staff were friendly and helpful overall , but in keeping up with the island mentality , their sense of urgency was lacking ( we had to ask two different people for hand towels and our one small room service order took close to an hour to arrive ) xxperiod actually , as mentioned by another reviewer , the food was the worst part xxperiod the presentation was excellent ( clean buffet areas , nicely decorated theme restaurants ) , but the dinner food quality wasn ?

? xxunk the wait xxunk great xxperiod considering all of this , the excellence was a great setting for relaxation xxperiod the grounds were beautiful , the weather was pleasant and there were many options for activities ( and spa treatments ) if you wanted them xxperiod i would definitely go back xxperiod one note - coordinate travel to and from the hotel beforehand if you can xxperiod the hotel is over an hour away from the airport , so you 'll want to skip the can i help you , sir xxperiod bidding wars between different transportation companies xxperiod one more note - the resort is on the atlantic side of the ocean xxperiod that means rough seas and cold ( er ) water xxperiod if you intend to spend your entire vacation in the ocean , you may want to skip this place xxperiod i went in a few times , but i quickly became content just relaxing by the water when i couldn ? ? go in it xxperiod,xxbos somewhat excellence we just returned from a one week stay at excellence punta cana from xxunk to xxunk xxperiod we are seasoned travelers and have stayed at a dozen all inclusives xxperiod we stayed at excellence punta cana in 2007 for two weeks , then excellence mayan riviera and then playa mujeres and now just returned from our second time to punta cana xxperiod we love excellence xxperiod so here goes the staff at excellence i rate 5 star all the way they are an amazing group of people friendly hard working and makes your stay wonderful xxperiod pool beach and grounds a solid five star ca not say more then wow xxperiod now for the rooms we traveled as three couples all oceanview excellence club seen all three rooms and they are all in need of work the rooms are showing there age all over the place a 4 rating is generous xxperiod food a 3 rating very incosistent cold most of the time under cooked over cooked , the new ala carte menus has less selection and was not impressed at all xxperiod deffinately a great decline since our last trip two years ago xxperiod excellence club we did it in 2007 and that is why we all choose to do it again i rate it a three the only thing good was the view and the ability for late check out as we had a late flight home xxperiod but for its service i rate it a 3 xxperiod excellence club was closed upon our late arrival so they gave us our keys and sent us on our way in pitch darkness we knew where we where going so we led the other two couples we traveled with too their rooms xxperiod their service was very inconsistent beach towels in all of our three club rooms only once xxperiod went to excellence club three times for a channel changer in the end tipped staff and they got one from an unoccupied room xxperiod turn down hit and miss had to ask for bathroom amenities , would not exchange any liquor bottles in room which they did the first time we where there xxperiod the club lounge it self which used to have plenty of food to choose from literally had nothing during the day and evening cheese some fruit and bread not at all like it was excellence club has xxunk there service big time xxperiod the staff tended better to you then excellence club staff xxperiod we requested top floor for all three rooms and after all our returns we thought that was not an unreasonable request and we did not get one top floor room xxperiod save your money and shame on you excellence club for your lack of service xxperiod all three rooms had very xxunk fridge stalking and was only resolved with a tip and even then once when givin a tip was not done xxperiod i will not be returning to excellence punta cana and it is sliding down the charts for a reason xxperiod in saying all this we traveled with two other couples and we all had a fabulous time we just feel we did not get what we xxunk for xxperiod anyone with questions please do not hesitate to contact me xxperiod\n",

       "xxbos definitely not a 5 star resort i ' m dumbfounded that this hotel gets good reviews and is so highly rated xxperiod it 's decidedly a 3 star property , not 5 stars as indicated xxperiod the rooms are very dated and run down , old crappy beds and pillows , an old tv and overall poorly maintained xxperiod the whole property is pretty run down and old - looking xxperiod the food is subpar , not one meal i had would be called great xxperiod the service is uneven and the staff is poorly trained and uninformed xxperiod many do not comprehend english xxperiod the beach is great , it 's the only redeeming factor xxperiod however the resort is a 1- hour taxi trip from the airport xxperiod,xxbos facilities need work xxperiod we visited excellence for 5 nights in december xxperiod our first room , # xxunk , had a safe that did not work and so - so air conditioning xxperiod when we went to the front desk to complain , we were told to go to the room and someone would be there within 15 minutes xxperiod 45 minutes later , the safe guy showed up , but nobody for the a / c xxperiod the safe guy could not fix it xxperiod when he left , the electricity went out xxperiod it went out a second time before we finally went to the front desk to change rooms xxperiod we had dinner that night in the lobster house xxperiod do not waste your time on this one xxperiod the lobster tails had about 2 bites of food included xxperiod while we were in there , the electricity went out again xxperiod room xxunk served us pretty well , until night # 3 when my partner got up to go to the bathroom and stepped into an inch of water xxperiod a hose had broken on the back of the toilet and flooded our room xxperiod it would ' ve been ok , but when we went to the front desk we were told that we needed to wait until noon to see if perhaps they could move us to another room xxperiod the front desk clerks were not xxunk to just move us xxperiod my partner was infuriated that they wanted us to wait 4 hours for a new room xxperiod finally , matias at the front desk finally arranged to have us moved to another upgraded room - xxunk xxperiod we walked in and saw the leak coming from the ceiling and nearly flipped xxperiod we finally got into # xxunk , which was a gorgeous suite with a beautiful view xxperiod on the positive side , the food at the other restaurants was very good xxperiod i particularly liked the french restaurant , while my partner liked the asian restaurant xxperiod the breakfast buffet was like nothing i 'd ever seen before - lots of choices xxperiod the ocean was way too rough to enjoy , particularly if you 're not a strong swimmer xxperiod much of the beach was black flagged the entire time we were there , so if you 're a big ocean fan , i do not recommend this resort xxperiod my favorite part , by far , though , were the beds next to the pools and ocean xxperiod they were amazing xxperiod i guess you could particularly say so since the beds in the rooms were hard as rocks xxperiod all in all , a good trip - highly recommend the zip line tour xxperiod it was worth every penny xxperiod,xxbos excellence was exactly that xxperiod my family and i stayed at the excellence punta cana from december 22 to december 29 of this year xxperiod it was an amazing time had by all that attended xxperiod we arrived at the resort around 4 am because of a delay at the airport in vancouver , but even at 4 am , the service of the bellhops and the front desk was up to par xxperiod our bags were unloaded and immediately tagged and set to one side of the lobby while we were handed cold scented towels to cool off with xxperiod check in was fairly expedient and we were in our rooms within twenty minutes xxperiod i had never been to an all inclusive resort before , and wasted no time enjoying the pleasures of the mini bar in the room , as well as the ample storage space for our things xxperiod room service even at 4 am was great , the girl on the phone said it would be about 40 minutes for the food , which seemed a little long , but i think they only say that to cover there butts , because it took about 25 minutes at most xxperiod the activities during the day were well thought out , though , there was some delays and cancellations due to weather conditions ( beach volleyball cancelled to due strong winds xxperiod the entertainment staff was amazing and extremely friendly , a special thanks to all my friends , ines ( my fiance , ) altagracia ( who lovingly xxunk to me as xxunk loco , which translates into crazy skinny guy , ) xxunk and johanna ( my disco dance partners , ) sexy cesar ( who taught me all the sexy dance moves i xxperiod now know , ) julio cesar ( the mc for the games and parties xxperiod the restaurants i ca not offer too much help with , i did not eat at all of them , but of the few i did eat at , i recommend toscana for the huge buffet everyday , breakfast here is well prepared and quite delicious ( although i do not recommend the scrambled eggs xxperiod the omlettes are delicious and you have to try one xxperiod for lunch , you have to check out the grill on the beach , different food everyday , always good , and makes the beach smell amazing xxperiod for dinner , i liked spice ( asian cuisine , ) agave ( mexican , but do not eat the xxunk from here , very rubbery , ) the pizza that is delivered to the pool and the beach is awesome , make sure you try that xxperiod the bars were awesome , you get accustomed to speaking the language when ordering drinks , instead of drinking your usual bacardi and coke , try the brugal extra anejo , they call it the dominican xxunk , and it 's obvious why once you try it xxperiod the stuff tastes amazing and it does magic for someone trying to loosen up on the dance floor xxperiod the disco is great too , although sometimes a little empty , but still worth checking out xxperiod the worst part of my trip was the vendors , they do not let up , and i am a very well mannered person , which makes it hard to shut them down over and over again , make sure you do not tell them you like anything until you know you 're going to buy it , otherwise you 'll have to beat xxperiod them off with a stick to get away xxperiod try to make it to the theatre for the shows at 10 pm every night , they are worth it xxperiod the ice breaker shows are fun too , it gets people into the swing of things xxperiod all in all , i would highly recommend this resort for anyone going on a honeymoon or a romantic time with the better half , there is not a very big single crowd , so parents beware taking your single sons and daughters to this resort if they 're looking to party with other singles xxperiod hope this helps you xxperiod adios amigos and xxunk xxperiod,xxbos great service , nice hotel , mediocre food xxperiod my husband and i stayed at excellence for five nights mid - november xxperiod we booked our trip at the very last minute so we were not able to do a ton of research on the dominican but the hotel receives high ratings xxunk the web xxperiod after the one hour ride from the airport we arrived at the hotel and were greeted by everyone we met xxperiod i have to say that the staff at the hotel were very nice and made every effort to learn our names and greet us by name each time they saw us xxperiod we opted to upgrade to the excellence club and we are still trying to decide if we think it was worth it or not xxperiod as part of the excellence club , you are ushered to the club 's private lobby for check - in but , really , it almost just creates an xxunk step in the check - in process and adds another person or two you feel like you should tip xxperiod the biggest benefits of the excellence club for us were the unlimited internet access , beach towels in the room ( they were hard to get otherwise ) , and the beach bag in our room xxperiod we did eat breakfast each morning in the excellence club which was nice because it was a small buffet and you did not have to deal with a crowd xxperiod the hotel itself was clean , the staff was very friendly , and nothing ever felt crowded xxperiod however , the food was not great xxperiod it was not bad - but it was not great xxperiod i ' m not a big eater but i was prepared to indulge on my vacation and there just was not anything i was crazy about xxperiod the presentation of the food was nice but it was just bland xxperiod i think that is the best way to describe it xxperiod the pizzas that were delivered to the pool area were good but it was unpredictable because you never knew when they would arrive xxperiod we went on two excursions - swimming with the sting - rays / sharks and the zip - line tour xxperiod we loved the zip - line excursion xxperiod the staff was great and our bus driver and tour guide were great xxperiod it was interesting to visit the sting - rays and swim with the sharks but the reef where we snorkeled was disappointing xxperiod the fish were very small and there was not much to see xxperiod the electricity went out in our room a handful of times , especially when i used the hairdryer xxperiod also , our ac was terrible xxperiod they tried to repair it but it just never got cool xxperiod our room was big , though , and clean xxperiod we always got housekeeping service twice a day and they refilled our mini - bar daily xxperiod in many of the reviews , people said they got sick xxperiod our representative at the hotel ( through aaa ) warned us that many people think they get sick from the water or the food but they do not realize that having too many drinks with coconut in them will also do it xxperiod coconut is a natural laxative so you need to limit your consumption xxperiod i would still pack the immodium just to be sure xxperiod i could not decide if i wanted to give this hotel a 3 / 5 or a 4 / 5 but i decided to go up because of the friendly staff and the cleanliness of our room xxperiod i do not think i would go back because of the food but we had a nice time while we were there xxperiod we met a lot of great people at the swim up bar xxperiod,xxbos very relaxing experience just returned from my 40th birthday romantic getaway with my husband xxperiod this was our first time in the dominican republic , and we have literally been to every single island in the caribbean xxperiod so i can assure you that my review will be short , sweet , and comprehensive xxperiod in general , we liked the dr , and the excellence was very nice xxperiod the top reasons why we liked excellence were : 1 ) no kids ( ie xxperiod , if i want to get away from my own kids , i definitely do not want to vacation with other peoples ' kids ) xxperiod it was so quiet xxperiod 2 ) the staff and the people in the dr in general xxperiod so genuinely friendly , helpful , and wonderful xxperiod believe me , this is not true in most other areas of the caribbean xxperiod the all - inclusive feature xxperiod loved being served , served , served xxperiod i wanted to sit on my [ - - ] all day and just be a xxunk pig xxperiod and this is the perfect place to do it xxperiod 4 ) the best selection of beach and pool lounge chairs , beds , and hammocks i ' ve ever seen xxperiod there were palapas everywhere , so there was no shortage of shade xxperiod there were so many beds , you did not have to worry about not getting one xxperiod i 'd never had the chance to sleep on a beach bed , because usually hotels have only a few , so you end up looking xxunk at the lucky few who get them xxperiod ok , so here 's what i did not love about excellence :1 ) beach is not swimmable xxperiod way too rough most of the time xxperiod for this reason alone , i 'd not return here xxperiod i ' m a beach fan , and love to swim in the warm caribbean sea xxperiod i ' m no food snob , but some of the food was downright bad xxperiod and you end up eating in the same spot for breakfast and lunch xxperiod even though they have like 7 restaurants - the majority of them are only open for dinner xxperiod we only stayed 4 nights , and we were definitely getting very tired of the breakfast / lunch selection by the 3rd day xxperiod overall , if you just want to relax by the pool and you do not care about not going in the beach , this is a very beautiful resort xxperiod the staff is wonderful xxperiod if you are looking for a place to party and be loud and crazy , this is not your place xxperiod\n",

       "xxbos definitely not a 5 star resort i ' m dumbfounded that this hotel gets good reviews and is so highly rated xxperiod it 's decidedly a 3 star property , not 5 stars as indicated xxperiod the rooms are very dated and run down , old crappy beds and pillows , an old tv and overall poorly maintained xxperiod the whole property is pretty run down and old - looking xxperiod the food is subpar , not one meal i had would be called great xxperiod the service is uneven and the staff is poorly trained and uninformed xxperiod many do not comprehend english xxperiod the beach is great , it 's the only redeeming factor xxperiod however the resort is a 1- hour taxi trip from the airport xxperiod,xxbos facilities need work xxperiod we visited excellence for 5 nights in december xxperiod our first room , # xxunk , had a safe that did not work and so - so air conditioning xxperiod when we went to the front desk to complain , we were told to go to the room and someone would be there within 15 minutes xxperiod 45 minutes later , the safe guy showed up , but nobody for the a / c xxperiod the safe guy could not fix it xxperiod when he left , the electricity went out xxperiod it went out a second time before we finally went to the front desk to change rooms xxperiod we had dinner that night in the lobster house xxperiod do not waste your time on this one xxperiod the lobster tails had about 2 bites of food included xxperiod while we were in there , the electricity went out again xxperiod room xxunk served us pretty well , until night # 3 when my partner got up to go to the bathroom and stepped into an inch of water xxperiod a hose had broken on the back of the toilet and flooded our room xxperiod it would ' ve been ok , but when we went to the front desk we were told that we needed to wait until noon to see if perhaps they could move us to another room xxperiod the front desk clerks were not xxunk to just move us xxperiod my partner was infuriated that they wanted us to wait 4 hours for a new room xxperiod finally , matias at the front desk finally arranged to have us moved to another upgraded room - xxunk xxperiod we walked in and saw the leak coming from the ceiling and nearly flipped xxperiod we finally got into # xxunk , which was a gorgeous suite with a beautiful view xxperiod on the positive side , the food at the other restaurants was very good xxperiod i particularly liked the french restaurant , while my partner liked the asian restaurant xxperiod the breakfast buffet was like nothing i 'd ever seen before - lots of choices xxperiod the ocean was way too rough to enjoy , particularly if you 're not a strong swimmer xxperiod much of the beach was black flagged the entire time we were there , so if you 're a big ocean fan , i do not recommend this resort xxperiod my favorite part , by far , though , were the beds next to the pools and ocean xxperiod they were amazing xxperiod i guess you could particularly say so since the beds in the rooms were hard as rocks xxperiod all in all , a good trip - highly recommend the zip line tour xxperiod it was worth every penny xxperiod,xxbos excellence was exactly that xxperiod my family and i stayed at the excellence punta cana from december 22 to december 29 of this year xxperiod it was an amazing time had by all that attended xxperiod we arrived at the resort around 4 am because of a delay at the airport in vancouver , but even at 4 am , the service of the bellhops and the front desk was up to par xxperiod our bags were unloaded and immediately tagged and set to one side of the lobby while we were handed cold scented towels to cool off with xxperiod check in was fairly expedient and we were in our rooms within twenty minutes xxperiod i had never been to an all inclusive resort before , and wasted no time enjoying the pleasures of the mini bar in the room , as well as the ample storage space for our things xxperiod room service even at 4 am was great , the girl on the phone said it would be about 40 minutes for the food , which seemed a little long , but i think they only say that to cover there butts , because it took about 25 minutes at most xxperiod the activities during the day were well thought out , though , there was some delays and cancellations due to weather conditions ( beach volleyball cancelled to due strong winds xxperiod the entertainment staff was amazing and extremely friendly , a special thanks to all my friends , ines ( my fiance , ) altagracia ( who lovingly xxunk to me as xxunk loco , which translates into crazy skinny guy , ) xxunk and johanna ( my disco dance partners , ) sexy cesar ( who taught me all the sexy dance moves i xxperiod now know , ) julio cesar ( the mc for the games and parties xxperiod the restaurants i ca not offer too much help with , i did not eat at all of them , but of the few i did eat at , i recommend toscana for the huge buffet everyday , breakfast here is well prepared and quite delicious ( although i do not recommend the scrambled eggs xxperiod the omlettes are delicious and you have to try one xxperiod for lunch , you have to check out the grill on the beach , different food everyday , always good , and makes the beach smell amazing xxperiod for dinner , i liked spice ( asian cuisine , ) agave ( mexican , but do not eat the xxunk from here , very rubbery , ) the pizza that is delivered to the pool and the beach is awesome , make sure you try that xxperiod the bars were awesome , you get accustomed to speaking the language when ordering drinks , instead of drinking your usual bacardi and coke , try the brugal extra anejo , they call it the dominican xxunk , and it 's obvious why once you try it xxperiod the stuff tastes amazing and it does magic for someone trying to loosen up on the dance floor xxperiod the disco is great too , although sometimes a little empty , but still worth checking out xxperiod the worst part of my trip was the vendors , they do not let up , and i am a very well mannered person , which makes it hard to shut them down over and over again , make sure you do not tell them you like anything until you know you 're going to buy it , otherwise you 'll have to beat xxperiod them off with a stick to get away xxperiod try to make it to the theatre for the shows at 10 pm every night , they are worth it xxperiod the ice breaker shows are fun too , it gets people into the swing of things xxperiod all in all , i would highly recommend this resort for anyone going on a honeymoon or a romantic time with the better half , there is not a very big single crowd , so parents beware taking your single sons and daughters to this resort if they 're looking to party with other singles xxperiod hope this helps you xxperiod adios amigos and xxunk xxperiod,xxbos great service , nice hotel , mediocre food xxperiod my husband and i stayed at excellence for five nights mid - november xxperiod we booked our trip at the very last minute so we were not able to do a ton of research on the dominican but the hotel receives high ratings xxunk the web xxperiod after the one hour ride from the airport we arrived at the hotel and were greeted by everyone we met xxperiod i have to say that the staff at the hotel were very nice and made every effort to learn our names and greet us by name each time they saw us xxperiod we opted to upgrade to the excellence club and we are still trying to decide if we think it was worth it or not xxperiod as part of the excellence club , you are ushered to the club 's private lobby for check - in but , really , it almost just creates an xxunk step in the check - in process and adds another person or two you feel like you should tip xxperiod the biggest benefits of the excellence club for us were the unlimited internet access , beach towels in the room ( they were hard to get otherwise ) , and the beach bag in our room xxperiod we did eat breakfast each morning in the excellence club which was nice because it was a small buffet and you did not have to deal with a crowd xxperiod the hotel itself was clean , the staff was very friendly , and nothing ever felt crowded xxperiod however , the food was not great xxperiod it was not bad - but it was not great xxperiod i ' m not a big eater but i was prepared to indulge on my vacation and there just was not anything i was crazy about xxperiod the presentation of the food was nice but it was just bland xxperiod i think that is the best way to describe it xxperiod the pizzas that were delivered to the pool area were good but it was unpredictable because you never knew when they would arrive xxperiod we went on two excursions - swimming with the sting - rays / sharks and the zip - line tour xxperiod we loved the zip - line excursion xxperiod the staff was great and our bus driver and tour guide were great xxperiod it was interesting to visit the sting - rays and swim with the sharks but the reef where we snorkeled was disappointing xxperiod the fish were very small and there was not much to see xxperiod the electricity went out in our room a handful of times , especially when i used the hairdryer xxperiod also , our ac was terrible xxperiod they tried to repair it but it just never got cool xxperiod our room was big , though , and clean xxperiod we always got housekeeping service twice a day and they refilled our mini - bar daily xxperiod in many of the reviews , people said they got sick xxperiod our representative at the hotel ( through aaa ) warned us that many people think they get sick from the water or the food but they do not realize that having too many drinks with coconut in them will also do it xxperiod coconut is a natural laxative so you need to limit your consumption xxperiod i would still pack the immodium just to be sure xxperiod i could not decide if i wanted to give this hotel a 3 / 5 or a 4 / 5 but i decided to go up because of the friendly staff and the cleanliness of our room xxperiod i do not think i would go back because of the food but we had a nice time while we were there xxperiod we met a lot of great people at the swim up bar xxperiod,xxbos very relaxing experience just returned from my 40th birthday romantic getaway with my husband xxperiod this was our first time in the dominican republic , and we have literally been to every single island in the caribbean xxperiod so i can assure you that my review will be short , sweet , and comprehensive xxperiod in general , we liked the dr , and the excellence was very nice xxperiod the top reasons why we liked excellence were : 1 ) no kids ( ie xxperiod , if i want to get away from my own kids , i definitely do not want to vacation with other peoples ' kids ) xxperiod it was so quiet xxperiod 2 ) the staff and the people in the dr in general xxperiod so genuinely friendly , helpful , and wonderful xxperiod believe me , this is not true in most other areas of the caribbean xxperiod the all - inclusive feature xxperiod loved being served , served , served xxperiod i wanted to sit on my [ - - ] all day and just be a xxunk pig xxperiod and this is the perfect place to do it xxperiod 4 ) the best selection of beach and pool lounge chairs , beds , and hammocks i ' ve ever seen xxperiod there were palapas everywhere , so there was no shortage of shade xxperiod there were so many beds , you did not have to worry about not getting one xxperiod i 'd never had the chance to sleep on a beach bed , because usually hotels have only a few , so you end up looking xxunk at the lucky few who get them xxperiod ok , so here 's what i did not love about excellence :1 ) beach is not swimmable xxperiod way too rough most of the time xxperiod for this reason alone , i 'd not return here xxperiod i ' m a beach fan , and love to swim in the warm caribbean sea xxperiod i ' m no food snob , but some of the food was downright bad xxperiod and you end up eating in the same spot for breakfast and lunch xxperiod even though they have like 7 restaurants - the majority of them are only open for dinner xxperiod we only stayed 4 nights , and we were definitely getting very tired of the breakfast / lunch selection by the 3rd day xxperiod overall , if you just want to relax by the pool and you do not care about not going in the beach , this is a very beautiful resort xxperiod the staff is wonderful xxperiod if you are looking for a place to party and be loud and crazy , this is not your place xxperiod\n",
