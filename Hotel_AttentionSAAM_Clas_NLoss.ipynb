lots of choices xxperiod the ocean was way too rough to enjoy , particularly if you 're not a strong swimmer xxperiod much of the beach was black flagged the entire time we were there , so if you 're a big ocean fan , i do not recommend this resort xxperiod my favorite part , by far , though , were the beds next to the pools and ocean xxperiod they were amazing xxperiod i guess you could particularly say so since the beds in the rooms were hard as rocks xxperiod all in all , a good trip - highly recommend the zip line tour xxperiod it was worth every penny xxperiod,xxbos excellence was exactly that xxperiod my family and i stayed at the excellence punta cana from december 22 to december 29 of this year xxperiod it was an amazing time had by all that attended xxperiod we arrived at the resort around 4 am because of a delay at the airport in vancouver , but even at 4 am , the service of the bellhops and the front desk was up to par xxperiod our bags were unloaded and immediately tagged and set to one side of the lobby while we were handed cold scented towels to cool off with xxperiod check in was fairly expedient and we were in our rooms within twenty minutes xxperiod i had never been to an all inclusive resort before , and wasted no time enjoying the pleasures of the mini bar in the room , as well as the ample storage space for our things xxperiod room service even at 4 am was great , the girl on the phone said it would be about 40 minutes for the food , which seemed a little long , but i think they only say that to cover there butts , because it took about 25 minutes at most xxperiod the activities during the day were well thought out , though , there was some delays and cancellations due to weather conditions ( beach volleyball cancelled to due strong winds xxperiod the entertainment staff was amazing and extremely friendly , a special thanks to all my friends , ines ( my fiance , ) altagracia ( who lovingly xxunk to me as xxunk loco , which translates into crazy skinny guy , ) xxunk and johanna ( my disco dance partners , ) sexy cesar ( who taught me all the sexy dance moves i xxperiod now know , ) julio cesar ( the mc for the games and parties xxperiod the restaurants i ca not offer too much help with , i did not eat at all of them , but of the few i did eat at , i recommend toscana for the huge buffet everyday , breakfast here is well prepared and quite delicious ( although i do not recommend the scrambled eggs xxperiod the omlettes are delicious and you have to try one xxperiod for lunch , you have to check out the grill on the beach , different food everyday , always good , and makes the beach smell amazing xxperiod for dinner , i liked spice ( asian cuisine , ) agave ( mexican , but do not eat the xxunk from here , very rubbery , ) the pizza that is delivered to the pool and the beach is awesome , make sure you try that xxperiod the bars were awesome , you get accustomed to speaking the language when ordering drinks , instead of drinking your usual bacardi and coke , try the brugal extra anejo , they call it the dominican xxunk , and it 's obvious why once you try it xxperiod the stuff tastes amazing and it does magic for someone trying to loosen up on the dance floor xxperiod the disco is great too , although sometimes a little empty , but still worth checking out xxperiod the worst part of my trip was the vendors , they do not let up , and i am a very well mannered person , which makes it hard to shut them down over and over again , make sure you do not tell them you like anything until you know you 're going to buy it , otherwise you 'll have to beat xxperiod them off with a stick to get away xxperiod try to make it to the theatre for the shows at 10 pm every night , they are worth it xxperiod the ice breaker shows are fun too , it gets people into the swing of things xxperiod all in all , i would highly recommend this resort for anyone going on a honeymoon or a romantic time with the better half , there is not a very big single crowd , so parents beware taking your single sons and daughters to this resort if they 're looking to party with other singles xxperiod hope this helps you xxperiod adios amigos and xxunk xxperiod,xxbos great service , nice hotel , mediocre food xxperiod my husband and i stayed at excellence for five nights mid - november xxperiod we booked our trip at the very last minute so we were not able to do a ton of research on the dominican but the hotel receives high ratings xxunk the web xxperiod after the one hour ride from the airport we arrived at the hotel and were greeted by everyone we met xxperiod i have to say that the staff at the hotel were very nice and made every effort to learn our names and greet us by name each time they saw us xxperiod we opted to upgrade to the excellence club and we are still trying to decide if we think it was worth it or not xxperiod as part of the excellence club , you are ushered to the club 's private lobby for check - in but , really , it almost just creates an xxunk step in the check - in process and adds another person or two you feel like you should tip xxperiod the biggest benefits of the excellence club for us were the unlimited internet access , beach towels in the room ( they were hard to get otherwise ) , and the beach bag in our room xxperiod we did eat breakfast each morning in the excellence club which was nice because it was a small buffet and you did not have to deal with a crowd xxperiod the hotel itself was clean , the staff was very friendly , and nothing ever felt crowded xxperiod however , the food was not great xxperiod it was not bad - but it was not great xxperiod i ' m not a big eater but i was prepared to indulge on my vacation and there just was not anything i was crazy about xxperiod the presentation of the food was nice but it was just bland xxperiod i think that is the best way to describe it xxperiod the pizzas that were delivered to the pool area were good but it was unpredictable because you never knew when they would arrive xxperiod we went on two excursions - swimming with the sting - rays / sharks and the zip - line tour xxperiod we loved the zip - line excursion xxperiod the staff was great and our bus driver and tour guide were great xxperiod it was interesting to visit the sting - rays and swim with the sharks but the reef where we snorkeled was disappointing xxperiod the fish were very small and there was not much to see xxperiod the electricity went out in our room a handful of times , especially when i used the hairdryer xxperiod also , our ac was terrible xxperiod they tried to repair it but it just never got cool xxperiod our room was big , though , and clean xxperiod we always got housekeeping service twice a day and they refilled our mini - bar daily xxperiod in many of the reviews , people said they got sick xxperiod our representative at the hotel ( through aaa ) warned us that many people think they get sick from the water or the food but they do not realize that having too many drinks with coconut in them will also do it xxperiod coconut is a natural laxative so you need to limit your consumption xxperiod i would still pack the immodium just to be sure xxperiod i could not decide if i wanted to give this hotel a 3 / 5 or a 4 / 5 but i decided to go up because of the friendly staff and the cleanliness of our room xxperiod i do not think i would go back because of the food but we had a nice time while we were there xxperiod we met a lot of great people at the swim up bar xxperiod,xxbos very relaxing experience just returned from my 40th birthday romantic getaway with my husband xxperiod this was our first time in the dominican republic , and we have literally been to every single island in the caribbean xxperiod so i can assure you that my review will be short , sweet , and comprehensive xxperiod in general , we liked the dr , and the excellence was very nice xxperiod the top reasons why we liked excellence were : 1 ) no kids ( ie xxperiod , if i want to get away from my own kids , i definitely do not want to vacation with other peoples ' kids ) xxperiod it was so quiet xxperiod 2 ) the staff and the people in the dr in general xxperiod so genuinely friendly , helpful , and wonderful xxperiod believe me , this is not true in most other areas of the caribbean xxperiod the all - inclusive feature xxperiod loved being served , served , served xxperiod i wanted to sit on my [ - - ] all day and just be a xxunk pig xxperiod and this is the perfect place to do it xxperiod 4 ) the best selection of beach and pool lounge chairs , beds , and hammocks i ' ve ever seen xxperiod there were palapas everywhere , so there was no shortage of shade xxperiod there were so many beds , you did not have to worry about not getting one xxperiod i 'd never had the chance to sleep on a beach bed , because usually hotels have only a few , so you end up looking xxunk at the lucky few who get them xxperiod ok , so here 's what i did not love about excellence :1 ) beach is not swimmable xxperiod way too rough most of the time xxperiod for this reason alone , i 'd not return here xxperiod i ' m a beach fan , and love to swim in the warm caribbean sea xxperiod i ' m no food snob , but some of the food was downright bad xxperiod and you end up eating in the same spot for breakfast and lunch xxperiod even though they have like 7 restaurants - the majority of them are only open for dinner xxperiod we only stayed 4 nights , and we were definitely getting very tired of the breakfast / lunch selection by the 3rd day xxperiod overall , if you just want to relax by the pool and you do not care about not going in the beach , this is a very beautiful resort xxperiod the staff is wonderful xxperiod if you are looking for a place to party and be loud and crazy , this is not your place xxperiod\n",
